# Regex Locator
Chrome extension to help locate Regex Matches on web pages.

Originally I had the intention to write a chrome extension to help locate phone numbers in different formats within web pages, which means trying to match dom text nodes to different regex expressions, that's why I decided to make it a global thing and allow the final user to add their own regular expressions.

Best of luck for me.
